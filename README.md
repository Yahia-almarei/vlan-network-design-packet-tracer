# VLAN-Based Network Design (Cisco Packet Tracer)

## Project Overview
This project is a VLAN-based network design implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer.
It demonstrates network segmentation using VLANs, routing between VLANs, and
connectivity to a main server.



## Network Components
- Cisco ISR Router
- Cisco 2960 Switches
- Multiple PCs
- Main Server



## VLAN Configuration
- VLAN 2 – Network: 192.168.2.0/24
- VLAN 3 – Network: 192.168.7.0/24
- VLAN 4 – Network: 192.168.8.0/24

Each VLAN represents a separate network segment.



## Features
- VLAN segmentation
- Inter-VLAN routing
- Server connectivity
- Proper IP addressing and subnetting



## How to Open the Project
1. Install Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Download the `.pkt` file from this repository.
3. Open it using Cisco Packet Tracer.
4. Switch to Simulation mode to observe packet flow.
